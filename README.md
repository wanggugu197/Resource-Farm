## Introduction

- Unleash Resource Farm! Grow custom resource trees/blocks, harvest everything—ultra-flexible & fully customizable!

---

Resource Farm is a highly flexible resource-generation mod for Minecraft players and modpack creators! Transform how you gather materials by growing fully customizable resource trees—harvest a wide range of materials, from basic ores, wood, and building blocks to rare treasures, modded items, and magical resources, all from your own farmed trees.

Built around config-driven dynamic registration, this mod puts ample control in the hands of both players and pack authors: modpack creators can easily adjust key aspects of resource tree behavior via simple config files—no coding required—to match unique pack themes, balance needs, or gameplay styles. Casual players get intuitive default settings for straightforward, enjoyable resource farming, while power users can dive deep into customization to build bespoke resource ecosystems tailored to their world.
